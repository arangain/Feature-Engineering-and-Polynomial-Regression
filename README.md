**Feature Engineering and Polynomial Regression**

Overview:
- Demonstrates the use of feature engineering and polynomial regression to model non-linear data relationships using linear regression techniques.

Objectives:
- Explore and implement polynomial feature transformations to fit non-linear data.
- Utilize gradient descent to optimize the polynomial regression models.
- Investigate the impact of feature scaling on model performance and convergence speed.

Features:
- Creation of polynomial features to capture non-linear trends in data.
- Use of numpy for mathematical operations and matplotlib for visualization.
- Implementation of feature scaling via Z-score normalization to enhance gradient descent performance.

Visualizations:
- Scatter plots showing the actual data points and the predictions from the polynomial models.
- Visual comparison between the models with and without feature scaling.
